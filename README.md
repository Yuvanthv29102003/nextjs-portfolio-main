## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Yuvanthv29102003/nextjs-portfolio.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd nextjs-portfolio`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to view the website.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required for this project:

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- Tailwind CSS: A highly customizable CSS framework
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- React Icons: A collection of popular icons for React projects
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript
- FormSubmit: A simple form submission service that sends emails without requiring backend code

## Contact Form

The contact form on this website uses FormSubmit to handle email submissions. When a user submits the form, the data is sent to FormSubmit, which then forwards it to my email address. This approach eliminates the need for a backend server or API keys.

## Deployment

This website is deployed on Vercel, which provides a seamless deployment experience for Next.js applications.
